run_apexg4mc.sh is a script for batch running of APEXG4MC+SIMC.

It requires an environmental variable called SIMC to be set and
an infiles directory to be present at the top level (as for the
old APEX simulation by Vardan).

To run,
./run_apexg4mc.sh [jobname] [g4 macro name (without the .mac]

eg

./run_apexg4mc.sh mytest batch_apex
